You already have **all days (Day 1–Day 14) `TODAY_TASK.md`** in my last message — that block contains every day.

To make it easier to use “day by day” with Amazon Q, here’s the **same content split into 14 separate copy blocks**, one per day (so you can paste only one at a time).

---

### Day 1 — `TODAY_TASK.md`

```markdown
# Day 1 — TODAY_TASK.md
## Goal
Create a runnable local baseline for Utility Explorer (API + Postgres) with minimal repo scaffolding.

## Files allowed to change/create
- README.md
- .env.template
- docker-compose.yml
- utility-explorer-api/** (new Spring Boot project scaffolding)
- PROJECT_STATE.md (create/update)
- AI_IMPLEMENTATION_RULES.md (if missing, create placeholder and note)
- ARCHITECTURE.md (if missing, create placeholder and note)

## Requirements
- docker-compose starts Postgres.
- Spring Boot API starts locally (even with placeholder routes).
- Add Spring Boot Actuator and expose /actuator/health.
- Use env vars for DB config (12-factor).

## Acceptance checks (commands)
1) docker compose up -d
2) curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health  (or configured port)
Expected: UP (or a clear JSON response)

## Stop and ask if
- You need to decide a repo structure (monorepo vs two repos).
- Any dependency choice changes architecture (avoid).

## End-of-day output
- List files created/changed
- Exact run commands
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md (keep under 1 page)
```

### Day 2 — `TODAY_TASK.md`

```markdown
# Day 2 — TODAY_TASK.md
## Goal
Add Flyway and core DB schema migrations + minimal seed data (1 source + 1 metric).

## Files allowed to change/create
- utility-explorer-api/pom.xml
- utility-explorer-api/src/main/resources/application.yml (or properties)
- utility-explorer-api/src/main/resources/db/migration/*.sql
- docker-compose.yml (only if needed)
- PROJECT_STATE.md

## Requirements
- Flyway runs on app startup and creates tables:
  metric, source, source_config, source_run, region, fact_value
  raw_payload (optional but ok)
- Seed 1 metric + 1 source via migration.
- No schema guesswork beyond what is in ARCHITECTURE doc.

## Acceptance checks
1) docker compose up --build
2) API logs show Flyway applied successfully
3) DB contains tables + seed rows

## Stop and ask if
- You want to change the schema keys beyond what is defined.
- Unsure about primary key uniqueness for fact_value.

## End-of-day output
- Migration list and purpose
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md
```

### Day 3 — `TODAY_TASK.md`

```markdown
# Day 3 — TODAY_TASK.md
## Goal
Implement Catalog endpoints: GET /metrics, GET /sources, GET /coverage per OpenAPI.

## Files allowed to change/create
- utility-explorer-api/src/main/java/** (controllers/services/repos/dtos)
- utility-explorer-api/src/test/java/** (basic tests)
- PROJECT_STATE.md

## Requirements
- Responses must match openapi.yaml exactly for these endpoints.
- /coverage returns supportedGeoLevels and supportedGranularities (can be derived from metric table initially if needed).
- Implement ErrorResponse for 404/400.

## Acceptance checks
- curl /api/v1/metrics returns seeded metric
- curl /api/v1/sources returns seeded source
- curl /api/v1/coverage?metricId=...&sourceId=... returns valid JSON

## Stop and ask if
- Coverage cannot be represented using current schema (don’t invent new tables without approval).

## End-of-day output
- Endpoint list + sample curl
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md
```

### Day 4 — `TODAY_TASK.md`

```markdown
# Day 4 — TODAY_TASK.md
## Goal
Implement Regions endpoints: search, get region, children.

## Files allowed to change/create
- utility-explorer-api/src/main/java/**
- utility-explorer-api/src/main/resources/db/migration/*.sql (seed minimal regions)
- utility-explorer-api/src/test/java/**
- PROJECT_STATE.md

## Requirements
- Seed a small set of regions (at least: US states or a subset).
- Implement:
  GET /regions/search?q=
  GET /regions/{geoLevel}/{geoId}
  GET /regions/{geoLevel}/{geoId}/children
- Use DB only; no external geo APIs.

## Acceptance checks
- /regions/search?q=Kan returns Kansas
- /regions/STATE/20 returns Kansas
- children returns empty unless seeded (ok)

## Stop and ask if
- You want to add new geo levels (ZIP/CBSA). Not allowed without approval.

## End-of-day output
- Seeded regions summary
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md
```

### Day 5 — `TODAY_TASK.md`

```markdown
# Day 5 — TODAY_TASK.md
## Goal
Implement GET /map (read path) with legend stats and provenance per OpenAPI.

## Files allowed to change/create
- utility-explorer-api/src/main/java/**
- utility-explorer-api/src/test/java/**
- PROJECT_STATE.md

## Requirements
- /map reads from fact_value.
- Computes legend min/max; percentiles optional.
- Returns empty values array if no facts exist.
- Must not fabricate missing regions.

## Acceptance checks
- /map returns valid schema even with no data
- Add a test inserting sample facts and validate response values

## Stop and ask if
- Unsure whether missing regions should be omitted or returned as null entries (follow OpenAPI; if ambiguous, ask).

## End-of-day output
- Sample request/response
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md
```

### Day 6 — `TODAY_TASK.md`

```markdown
# Day 6 — TODAY_TASK.md
## Goal
Implement GET /timeseries and GET /export/csv.

## Files allowed to change/create
- utility-explorer-api/src/main/java/**
- utility-explorer-api/src/test/java/**
- PROJECT_STATE.md

## Requirements
- /timeseries returns sorted points in date range.
- Each point includes provenance (retrievedAt, optional sourcePublishedAt).
- /export/csv returns CSV with headers including provenance columns.

## Acceptance checks
- Insert sample facts; /timeseries returns expected points
- /export/csv downloads CSV and includes columns: periodStart, periodEnd, value, retrievedAt, sourcePublishedAt

## Stop and ask if
- Unsure about date range inclusivity (document chosen behavior).

## End-of-day output
- Example CSV header + sample row
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md
```

### Day 7 — `TODAY_TASK.md`

```markdown
# Day 7 — TODAY_TASK.md
## Goal
Implement GET /status/sources to support Transparency page.

## Files allowed to change/create
- utility-explorer-api/src/main/java/**
- utility-explorer-api/src/test/java/**
- PROJECT_STATE.md

## Requirements
- Return enabled flag + schedule cron + timezone per source_config.
- Include lastRun summary and lastSuccessAt if any runs exist.
- nextRunAt can be computed simply from cron; if hard, return null and note in PROJECT_STATE.

## Acceptance checks
- With no runs, endpoint still returns sources with null lastRun
- After inserting a run row, endpoint returns lastRun

## Stop and ask if
- Cron parsing requires a new dependency (ask before adding).

## End-of-day output
- Status payload example
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md
```

### Day 8 — `TODAY_TASK.md`

```markdown
# Day 8 — TODAY_TASK.md
## Goal
Add ingestion framework skeleton (dispatcher + locking + plugin interface) with a mock source plugin.

## Files allowed to change/create
- utility-explorer-api/src/main/java/**
- utility-explorer-api/src/test/java/**
- PROJECT_STATE.md

## Requirements
- Dispatcher runs on a fixed tick (env var INGESTION_TICK_SECONDS).
- Per-source lock prevents concurrent runs.
- Mock plugin writes deterministic facts and logs a source_run.
- Must be idempotent (re-run doesn’t create duplicate fact_value rows).

## Acceptance checks
- Enable ingestion and confirm source_run rows created
- Run twice → no duplicates in fact_value PK

## Stop and ask if
- Locking strategy is unclear (choose Postgres advisory lock if available; if uncertain, ask).

## End-of-day output
- How to enable/disable ingestion
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md
```

### Day 9 — `TODAY_TASK.md`

```markdown
# Day 9 — TODAY_TASK.md
## Goal
Source intake documentation + wiring (NO real ingestion if terms/cadence unknown).

## Files allowed to change/create
- SOURCES.md (new)
- utility-explorer-api/src/main/resources/db/migration/*.sql (seed new source metadata only)
- PROJECT_STATE.md

## Requirements
- Create SOURCES.md listing at least 1–2 intended sources with:
  doc link, terms link, cadence, geo levels, granularity, units.
- Only seed source metadata + config; do NOT write ingestion code unless fully documented.

## Acceptance checks
- /sources includes the new source(s)
- /status/sources shows their enabled/config state

## Stop and ask if
- Terms of use are unclear or redistrib is questionable.

## End-of-day output
- SOURCES.md summary
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md
```

### Day 10 — `TODAY_TASK.md`

```markdown
# Day 10 — TODAY_TASK.md (UI)
## Goal
Create Vue UI shell with routes: / (Map Explorer placeholder) and /transparency (static + status widget).

## Files allowed to change/create
- utility-explorer-ui/** (new Vue project scaffolding)
- utility-explorer-ui/.env.template
- utility-explorer-ui/README.md
- PROJECT_STATE.md

## Requirements
- UI runs locally.
- /transparency page calls /api/v1/status/sources and renders a simple table.
- No map yet beyond placeholder panel.

## Acceptance checks
- npm run dev works
- Transparency page renders and shows status list

## Stop and ask if
- Choosing mapping library (not today).

## End-of-day output

```

### Day 11 — `TODAY_TASK.md`

```markdown
# Day 11 — TODAY_TASK.md (UI Map)
## Goal

## Files allowed to change/create
- utility-explorer-ui/src/**
- PROJECT_STATE.md

## Requirements
- Load static boundary files (TopoJSON/GeoJSON) from local assets.
- Render STATE map boundaries.
- Fetch /api/v1/map and color states when values exist.
- If no values, show boundaries + “No data available”.

## Acceptance checks
- Boundaries render
- With seeded API facts, at least one region is colored

## Stop and ask if
- Unsure which boundary format to standardize (choose one and document).

## End-of-day output
- What file format used and where stored
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md
```

### Day 12 — `TODAY_TASK.md`

```markdown
# Day 12 — TODAY_TASK.md (Drawer + Chart + Export)
## Goal
Implement region click → drawer + time series chart + export CSV.

## Files allowed to change/create
- utility-explorer-ui/src/**
- PROJECT_STATE.md

## Requirements
- Click a region → open drawer with region name + current value + retrievedAt.
- Drawer fetches /timeseries and renders a line chart.
- Export button downloads CSV from /export/csv.
- Provenance must be visible in drawer.

## Acceptance checks
- Click works
- Chart renders when data exists
- Export downloads file

## Stop and ask if
- Chart library choice is unclear (pick minimal and document; avoid big dependencies).

## End-of-day output

- Implement QuerySpec internally and validate strictly.
- Implement one query type: INTERSECTION using latest common period (only using existing data).
- UI panel: input question, display result table + citations, “highlight on map” optional.

## Acceptance checks
- Without API key -> 401
- With key and data -> OK response
- With missing data -> INSUFFICIENT_DATA

## Stop and ask if
- QuerySpec semantics are ambiguous (ask before expanding).

## End-of-day output
- Example question + response
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md
```

### Day 14 — `TODAY_TASK.md`

```markdown
# Day 14 — TODAY_TASK.md (Hardening + Docs)
## Goal
Polish: tests, docs, demo walkthrough, and guardrail verification.

## Files allowed to change/create
- README.md
- DEMO.md
- utility-explorer-api/src/test/java/**
- utility-explorer-ui/** (minor polish only)
- PROJECT_STATE.md

## Requirements
- Add integration tests for key endpoints: /metrics, /sources, /map, /timeseries, /status.
- Add a DEMO.md with exact steps to reproduce:
  map view, drilldown, timeseries, export, transparency status.
- Verify “no invention” principle in UI and API (document it).

## Acceptance checks
- One-command local run path documented
- Tests pass

## Stop and ask if
- CI/CD setup is needed (out of scope for local-first MVP days).

## End-of-day output
- DEMO.md contents summary
- Update PROJECT_STATE.md
```

If you also want, I can generate:

* `PROJECT_STATE.md` starter (Day 0 baseline),
* `SOURCES.md` starter with placeholders,
* `DEMO.md` starter,
  so Day 1 begins with zero ambiguity.
